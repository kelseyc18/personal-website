          Learning about diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) ü§ù
        </h3>
        <p>
          I am not a DEI expert, but I've been trying to learn as much as I can
          about making tech more inclusive. These are some things I've worked on
          at my current company, <a href="https://coda.io/about">Coda</a>.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            After being inspired by Non-Binary People's Day, I pitched the idea
            to add an optional pronoun field to Coda Maker Profiles.
            <a
              href="https://community.coda.io/t/launched-pronouns-in-maker-profiles/17374"

          <li>
            After learning more about the experiences of trans and non-binary
            people, I led discussions on how to make our women's group more
            inclusive to other people with marginalized genders. We also updated
            our mission statement as a commitment to prioritizing
            intersectionality since gender is only one aspect of people's
            identities. Read more about

            During our last company hackathon, my team learned more about
            website accessibility and created
            <a href="https://coda.io/@charlotte/accessibility-audit-template"
              >an accessibility audit template</a
            >
            for unofficial audits. I also came up with some product design and
            engineering guidelines so that we can chip away at our accessibility
            debt.

            I'm keeping

        <h3 id="why-so-ugly">Why is this website so ugly? üö®</h3>
        <p>
          I was curious if I could make a decent website without using any
          custom styling. I also took this opportunity to learn how
          <a
            href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/landmarks/index.html"
            >ARIA landmarks</a
          >
          make websites more compatible with
          <a
            href="https://www.afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/using-technology/assistive-technology-products/screen-readers"
            title="List of screen readers provided by American Foundation for the Blind"
            >screen readers</a
          >. Turns out, it's quite simple! If you are using macOS, I recommend
          trying to navigate this webpage using the
          <a
            href="https://help.apple.com/voiceover/mac/10.15/#/vo2682"
            title="VoiceOver User Guide"
            >built-in VoiceOver software</a
          >. Windows users can use the
          <a
            href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/22798/windows-10-complete-guide-to-narrator"
            title="Narrator User Guide"
            >built-in Narrator</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are two tools you can use to test the accessibility of webpages:
          <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/"
            >WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool</a
          >
          and
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Accessibility_inspector"
            >Firefox Accessibility Inspector</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just to clarify, websites that are accessible can still look
          beautiful! This one just happens to be ugly.
