        <p>
          I am not a DEI expert, but I've been trying to learn as much as I can
          about making tech more inclusive. What's great is that you don't need
          to have "DEI" in your job title to make a difference! By recognizing
          our own privileges, we can help empower other people by ensuring that
          everyone feels welcome in tech and that the products we create are
          inclusive and accessible to everyone.

          These are some things I've worked on at my current company,
          <a href="https://coda.io/about">Coda</a>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            On International Non-Binary People's Day, I pitched the idea to add
            an optional pronoun field to Coda Maker Profiles.
            <a href="https://community.coda.io/t/launched-pronouns-in-maker-profiles/17374"
              title="Launch announcement for pronouns in Maker Profiles">We shipped the feature soon after!</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            After learning more about the experiences of transgender and non-binary
            people, I led discussions on how to make our women's group more
            inclusive to other people with marginalized genders. We also updated
            our mission statement as a commitment to prioritizing
            intersectionality since gender is only one aspect of people's
            identities. Read more about

          <li>
            My teammates and I learned more about website accessibility and created
            <a href="https://coda.io/@charlotte/accessibility-audit-template">an accessibility audit template</a>
            for unofficial audits. I also came up with some product design and
            engineering guidelines for creating accessible products.

            I'm keeping
            <a href="https://coda.io/@kelsey/learning-about-dei">a running list of DEI articles</a>
            that I've found helpful. Let me know if you have any suggestions!

          Reading
          <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25078.Savage_Inequalities">Savage Inequalities</a>
          by Jonathan Kozol opened my eyes to the inequities built into the
          American educational system. I may not have the knowledge or power to
          change the system at large, but I can do my part to promote equal
          access to computer science education.

        <p>Here are a few of my favorite teaching stints:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I spent three years teaching middle school girls and non-binary
            students how to program. Learn more about
            <a href="http://codeit.mit.edu/">MIT CodeIt</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            I taught computer science to Israeli and Palestinian high school
            students in Jerusalem and Nazareth. Learn more about
            <a href="https://meet.mit.edu/">Middle East Entrepreneurs of Tomorrow</a>

          </li>
          <li>
            I taught a STEM workshop in South Korea at Yeomyung School, a school
            for North Korean defectors. Check out
            <a href="https://gtlkorea2018.wordpress.com/">my Yeomyung teaching blog</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            I taught workshops at a hackathon for women and non-binary people.

        <p>
          I first learned about accessibility through a college class on assistive technology in 2015. A few years
          later,
          I spent my internship at <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> fixing accessibility
          issues based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility
            Guidelines (WCAG)</a>. Since then, I've taken the <a
            href="https://www.edx.org/course/web-accessibility-introduction">
            W3C Intro to Web Accessibility Course</a> on edX and attended several web accessibility virtual conferences
          to
          continue learning how to achieve organizational success with accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>Here are a few things I've done to make sure this website is accessible:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure colors satisfy the <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">color contrast
              ratio</a> for WCAG 2.1 Level AA.</li>
          <li>Provide <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/">alternative text</a> where
            applicable for images.</li>
          <li>Ensure that all functionality is <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspective-videos/keyboard/">
              accessible via keyboard</a> and that focus indicators are clearly visible.</li>
          <li>Use automated accessibility testers like
            <a href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/accessibility_inspector/index.html">Firefox
              Accessibility Inspector</a> and <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/browser-extensions/">axe DevTools</a>
            to detect issues.</li>
        </ul>
